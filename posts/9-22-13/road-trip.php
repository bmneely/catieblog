            <p>The "road trip" (it was only an hour outside Boise, so not really a road trip, but it felt forever away because of how quickly and dramatically the scenery changed) we took to Idaho City on Saturday didn't really pay off in the way of antique shopping as I'd hoped it would, but we got some ice cream and walked around a bit.</p>
            <p>We got to see some of the fire damage from this year on the way up.  You can sort of see it in the last picture.  That line that goes across the hill.  It was really bad in some places.  We saw a burned out house, and at least one place where the fire had jumped the fire line and just kept going until it finally stopped at the next fire line.  It wasn't more than 20 minutes outside Boise either, which put the whole thing in perspective a little.  I always feel like the fires are so far outside of town,but this didn't feel very far at all.  It makes more sense now why the air gets so weighed down with thick smoke, and why every time I blew my nose this summer, black stuff came out (sry, tmi).</p>
            <p>So, we left Idaho City pretty quickly and went back home.  Home is where we most enjoy spending our weekends anyway.  I sometimes feel like we're missing out by not doing enough (thus the Idaho City "road trip"), but it's just so much comfortable at home.  And I got to finish up some baby presents for Autumn, the new baby that's coming to Ben's side of the family in October.</p>

            <p>Can you tell it's been a while since I was able to sew for a baby girl?  I love all the little boys so, so much, but there's just something fun and sweet about girl things.</p>
            <p>The quilt is just a bunch of half triangles in aqua, grey, brown, mustard, and one pail sage green, against the white background and with a 4 inch white border all the way around.  It's approximately 40x40" square.  I don't know why I like square baby blankets as opposed to rectangular, but I do.</p>
            <p>The ball is an Amish puzzle ball and I made the pattern myself, which was pretty easy to do with a compass and some basic folding.  The pants are from this pattern, which was so easy and fun to make.  I want to make even more and have enough of the lightweight denim I used to make a few more pairs, I think.</p>
            <p>The rattle is from this etsy shop and is just darling, personalized with the baby's name.  Plus, added bonus, I got to get it in colors that matched the quilt!  It really shouldn't have thrilled me as much as it did, since I'm pretty sure it's terribly unhealthy to raise a baby with everything all matchy-match, but it was just too good, so I couldn't pass it up. I'm pretty sure every baby needs a rattle with their name on it, right?  I told myself they did when I saw the price, and it was worth every penny! ;)</p>
            <p>The weekend is already over and I so don't want to go back to work (I never do), but the mornings have been so much cooler lately, and it's even not-hot when I get off in the evening, so I'm telling myself it will be cozy there.  We'll see.</p>
